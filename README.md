## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is designed to show the user the current date and the hour of the day.  Each hour will be color coded so the user will know at a glance if the task was due in the past, or is currently due, or is due in the future.  Once the user hits save, the task is stored on their local storage.

## User Story
