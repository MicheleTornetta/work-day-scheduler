# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to 

save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS 

powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md

open the planner

current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down
I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future


click into a timeblock
enter an event

click the save button for that timeblock
event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
